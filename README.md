# Micro Drone Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a lightweight micro-drone controlled by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. The drone features a durable 3D-printed frame, fast brushed DC motors, and a robust control system utilizing Python-based software and wireless communication via WiFi. The design prioritizes cost-efficiency, simplicity, and functionality.

- **Power Supplies**:
  - **For Motors**: Tattu 1S 3.7V 600mAh 30C LiPo battery.
  - **For Raspberry Pi**: Nine Eagles 2S 7.4V 250mAh LiPo battery with an LD1117 voltage regulator (5V output).
- **Electronics**:
  - 4 x SUD50N025-06P logic-level MOSFETs for motor control.
  - 4 x SS24 diodes for protection.
  - Resistors: 4 x 10k (control), 4 x 1k (pull-down).
- **Frame**: 3D-printed with a 130mm layout, total weight: 80g.
- **Propellers**: 3D-printed, 4-inch diameter.
- **Sensors**:
  - MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyroscope).
  - Ultrasonic distance sensor for safe landing.

### Software
- **Languages**: Python
- **Key Modules**:
  - `client.py`: Sends control commands to the drone via WiFi, handles keyboard inputs.
  - `server.py`: Receives commands on the Raspberry Pi and routes them to motor controllers.
  - `fly_controll.py`: Implements flight stabilization by analyzing MPU6050 data and adjusting motor speeds.
  - `start_stop.py`: Manages take-off and landing using the ultrasonic sensor.
  - `gui.py`: Provides a graphical interface for controlling the drone, including connection status and directional buttons.

## Technical Specifications
### Power Calculation
- **Battery**: 600mAh, 3.7V, 30C (18A max discharge).
- **Estimated Flight Time**:
 ```
Flight time = ~3 min
```
- **Drone Weight**: 80g, with sufficient thrust for stable flight using 4 motors.

### Motor Speed Control
- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)**: 
- The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W generates PWM signals for each motor.
- Logic-level MOSFETs (SUD50N025-06P) modulate the current to the motors, controlling their speed.
- The duty cycle of the PWM signal determines the average voltage supplied to the motors.

 - Observed variation within 3%, ensuring balanced performance.
3. **Load Testing**:
 - Measured current draw and voltage under load conditions with propellers attached.

### Power System Tests
- **Regulator Stability**:
- Verified stable 5V output from the LD1117 regulator under Raspberry Pi and sensor load.
- **Battery Performance**:
- Observed slight voltage drop (3.7V to ~3.4V) during maximum motor load, consistent with LiPo behavior.
